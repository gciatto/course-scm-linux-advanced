## What is `systemd`? (pt. 1)

> `systemd` $\approx$ today's most common __init system__ for Linux systems

- but what's an _init system_ in the first place?

### The role of the _init system_

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
![](./boot-init.png)
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
The init system is the _first process_ started by the _kernel_
<br>
(this is why it has __PID=1__)

###
### Responsibilities

- _Starting_ all other _processes_ (namely, the __services__):
    + including the _display server_ (e.g. X, Wayland)
    + including the _window manager_ (e.g. Gnome, KDE)
    + including _daemons_ and _services_ (e.g. `sshd`, `httpd`)

- _Mounting_ the __file systems__
    + e.g. the _home_ partition, the _swap_ partition, etc.

- _Setting up_ the __network__
    + e.g. starting the _network manager_, hence connecting to the _default networks_, etc.

- Suspending/hibernating (and resuming), rebooting, and shutting down the system

The init system has:
1. started all the system services
1. mounted all the file systems
1. set up the network
1. started the display server
1. started the window manager
1. started the user session

## Init systems

- [SysVinit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) (1980sâ€”early 2000s) first family of init systems for Unix-like systems

- [Upstart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart_(software)) (2006â€”2014) developed by Canonical for Ubuntu

- [runit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runit) (2004â€”present) used by niche Linux distributions

- [OpenRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRC) (2007â€”present) used by Gentoo and Alpine Linux

- [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) (2005â€”present) used by macOS, developed by Apple

- [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) (2010â€”present) inspired by `launchd`, used by most Linux distributions nowadays

- Comparison here: <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Comparison_of_init_systems>

## What is systemd? (pt. 2)

> __systemd__ is a _suite_ of system management __daemons__, __libraries__, and __utilities__ designed as a _central management and configuration platform_ for the Linux OS

{{< image src="systemd-components.svg" width="100%" >}}

---

## systemd's utilities suite

The systemd __suite__ includes the following _command-line_ utilities (corresponding to relevant _daemon_ services):

* `systemctl` controls the `systemd` daemon, from which system- and user-level _services_ can be managed

* `journalctl` queries messages from the `journald` daemon, which collects and stores _log messages_ from the kernel and services

* `hostnamectl` controls the `hostnamed` daemon, from which the _name of the host_ on the network can be read/set

* `loginctl` controls the `logind` daemon, which manages _user sessions_ and _seats_

* `timedatectl` controls the `timedated` daemon, which manages the _system clock_ and _time zone_

* `localectl` controls the `localed` daemon, which manages the _system locale_ and _keyboard layout_

* `busctl` controls the `bus-proxyd` daemon, which provides a _D-Bus_ interface to the system bus

* `networkctl` controls the `networkd` daemon, which manages _network configurations_

* `resolvectl` controls the `resolved` daemon, which manages _DNS_ configurations

---

## Remarks

> This lecture is about the usage of systemd as the __service manager__ for Linux
> <br>(i.e., put simply, how to use `systemctl` and `journalctl`)

- ... but the systemd suite is much more than that!

- Overall, systemd is a set of tool for _system administration_ 
    + you can control most aspects of a Linux system using systemd's utilities

{{% fragment %}}
### Beware!

- systemd is a __controversial__ piece of software inside the _FOSS_ community
    + it has been criticized because it [arguably violates](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-and-others-on-linuxs-systemd/) the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
    + it has been criticized as a _mission creep_ (i.e., it does too much) and as a _feature creep_ (i.e., it has too many features)
    + yet, it is the _de facto_ standard for most (and most relevant) [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#Adoption)

- Yet, __do not expect__ all distros to implement/support all the features of the systemd suite

### User Login and Session Management

2. Get an overview of the current situation with `loginctl` (no args):
    ```bash
    SESSION  UID USER SEAT  LEADER CLASS   TTY   IDLE SINCE

3. A bit of nomenclature:
    - __Session__: a _login session_ (e.g., a _TTY_ session, an _SSH_ session)
    - __User__: a _user account_ (e.g., `root`, `user`)
    - __Seat__: a _physical or virtual seat_ (e.g., a _display_, a _keyboard_, a _mouse_)

    - `unmanaged` $\approx$ the network is not managed by `networkd`
    - the warning means that the `networkd` is not running

            + to be controlled via the `nmcli` command   

3. Get the _status_ of a specific _connection_ with <br> `networkctl status LINK`

4. Use `networkctl up/down LINK` to affect the _connection_
    - which implies _connecting_ (up) or _disconnecting_ (down)
